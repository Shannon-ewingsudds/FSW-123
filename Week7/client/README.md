# Getting Started with Create React App

I created an API Website that lists the names of some Pokemon. My son loves playing Pokemon with his friends and it gave me an idea to use the Pokemon API. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The layout of the website is pretty simple. I have three pages: A Home page, A Pokemon page and a Giphy Page that show a photo of the Pokemon you search for. 

The home page just shows the title and it has a cool ttile page that I used a googlefont display the page and a bright Pikachu to welcome you to the website. 

The Pokemon page list some of the popular Pokemons. Here you are also able to add your own and delete Pokemon by clicking on the "X" (delete) button. 

The Giphy page defaults to a picture of a jumping Bulbasuar. It allows you to type yout favorite Pokemon to see what picture will show. 

I hope you enjoy this website and I hope you got to see your favorite Pokemon!
